# Rules for gift giving
## 1. Money
Don't spend so much you're going to put yourself out. No-one wants you to not be able to pay your electricity bill because you bought them a gift. I certainly don't, anyway. That sets the upper bound.

I'll buy a £3 cup of coffee without really thinking about it. I'll spend £5 on lunch and a drink without really thinking about it. The amount of money you spend on a gift, though, should be at a level where you have to think about whether it's actually a good use of the money. That sets the lower bound.

## 2. Think about it
Select a gift based on what you know about a person and what they like. It's fine for them to tell you what they like. And it's fine for you to ask.

### 3. Delight correlates strongly with unexpectedness
If can select something that the recipient wouldn't think to buy for themselves, you can significantly increase how delighted the recipient is with the gift.

This holds true if (and it's an important if) you're obeying the rules above. If not, results may be a bit more varied!
