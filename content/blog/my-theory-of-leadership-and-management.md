# My theories of what leadership and management are
I've recently read [The Mythical Man Month](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mythical_Man-Month) and [The Phoenix Project](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/the-phoenix-project/9781457191350/) recently. They're both excellent, and both are apparently about IT but are actually about management and leadership.

As I was coming to the end of _The Mythical Man Month_, I realised that I have quite well developed theories about what leadership, team management, and person management are. The lists are unordered, as they were scribbled in a Kindle note as I was finishing a chapter.

 I am surprised to discover quite how much of management and leadership involves gaining a deeper understanding of oneself. If you want a really good example of how this can be so, I'd recommend listening to the [Shadowed Qualities](https://gimletmedia.com/shows/startup/mehw5w/gimlet-23-shadowed-qualities) episode of Gimelt's _Start Up_ podcast. As an aside, I think this podcast might sit perfectly at the intersection of business journalism and poetry. It's amazing.

 Without further ado - I present my credo below:

## Leadership
* Developing and articulating vision
* Correspondingly, helping the organisation to prioritise
* Understanding the team's, and organisation's, strengths and weaknesses
* Facilitating communication, creativity, and decision making

## Team management
* Upholding agreements the team has made, to themselves and to others
* Modelling the team's ideal behaviour standards
* Protecting the team's time and attention
* Acquiring and defending resources the team needs 
* Promoting the team's good work to the rest of the organisation
* Facilitating the organising and scheduling of work 
* Facilitating goal-setting

## Person management
* Providing feedback 
* Listening openly and responding to questions humanly
* Setting expectations
* Enabling personal development
